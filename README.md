Kod Gemisi Sample Application
=============================

This application is provided as a base for your assigned work. It has a pre-configured database, security and MVC structure to help you get started quickly.

* http://semantic-ui.com/ is used for UI library.
* http://www.thymeleaf.org/ is used for templating.
* Spring MVC and Hibernate are used for frameworks.

Installation
------------

**1)** Create a database for the application

The application uses `postgresql` database by default. You can use another database if you wish however you need to configure the application accordingly in that case.

Following commands are provided as a hint to create a database and a database user for the application:

```bash
# for debian based linux OS

# Create a db user
~/<current_directory>$  sudo -u postgres createuser -D -A -P demouser
could not change directory to "/home/<username>/<current_directory>": Permission denied
Enter password for new role:
Enter it again:

# Create a db of which our db user is the owner
~/<current_directory>$ sudo -u postgres createdb -O demouser demodb
could not change directory to "/home/<username>/<current_directory>": Permission denied
~/<current_directory>$
```

**2)** Import the project _as a maven project_ into your IDE

**3)** Copy `application-sample.properties` as `application-dev.properties` and edit its content accordingly. (the file is in the path  `src/resources/application-sample.properties`)

Otherwise you will encounter following error:

```
org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanDefinitionStoreException: Failed to parse configuration class [RootConfig]; nested exception is java.io.FileNotFoundException: class path resource [application-dev.properties] cannot be opened because it does not exist
```

**4)** Run the application, it will create the database tables automatically for you thanks to Hibernate.

The path of application when deployed in Eclipse: `http://localhost:8080/sample/` and in Idea: `http://localhost:8080/`

**Default Credentials**

username: `user@kodgemisi.com`

password: `123qwe123`

Todos
-----

**1)** When you open `User > User list with items` page, there is an error occurs. Why this error occurs? Please solve it assuming application's performance is critical. Please describe alternative solutions if any and compare them.

**2)** Add `stockNumber` attribute to `Item` entity. Users should be able to add this new attribute to database, update it and see it in Item List page.

**3)** Add `image` attribute to `Item` entity. You are required to add an image upload feature to the existing Item Create page and store the image as you wish. Note that users should be able to see this uploaded image on the Item List page.

**4)** Create a Toggl Time Report App

We're using [toggl](https://toggl.com/) as time tracking app. Toggl gives us some reports about how much time we and our team spend on projects but we need some additional reports. We need to see our performance based on some metrics(1.1) and we need to see the current status of our colleagues(1.2).

4.1) **Performance Tool**

* User should register/login to the app. (You don't need to implement this part. App currently have login and register functionality.) What you need to do is make registration publicly available so that _anyone can register as a new user_.

* User should create a toggl api token and save it to the app (you may save token in settings/profile page or you may redirect user to save token page if user has not. You're free on the implementation)

* App should get all time entries of user since last two months and store them in database.

* App should give a list to the user with the date and performance metric and actual performance metric.

    * You need to calculate performance metric with proportion of time spent in a day to the total time in a day(8 hours by default). For example,  if a user logged 5 hours in a day, the performance index is 0.625
    * You need to calculate actual performance metric with proportion of time spent in a day to the total available time in a day. For example, user starts working at 9.30 and stops working at 16.30. Total available time is 6 hours. If user has logged 5 hours, the actual performance index is 0.83. Please note that user has a 1 hour lunch time, you need to decrease total time by 1 hour.
    * You're free to add additional features to the list. You may use a graph to show data, add a pagination to list, add filter, etc. You may want to cache performance metric and actual performance metric to make performance improvements.

You can see a mock of the performance report below:

4.2) **Team Status Tool**

* User should invite his teammates
* Teammate should register himself/herself to the app
* Teammate should create a toggl api token and save it to the app
* People should see the actual processes of teammates(You need to make a toggl api query with your teammates api token to learn the actual status of your teammate)

You can see a mock of the team report below:
